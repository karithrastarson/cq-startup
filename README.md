## Wordpress Migration Tool
Created 05-10-2016

I created a tool that takes a WordPress backup file, or a direct link to an xml feed of a WP site and creates the corresponding site structure on your CQ instance. This is done using the "Social" tools that ship with CQ5. The data structure created for the WP archive is described in another repository on my github account. And that stand alone tool can be found there as well. [WP Archiving Tool](https://github.com/karithrastarson/wp-xml-parser)
